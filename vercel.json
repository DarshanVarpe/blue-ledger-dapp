{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

* `"source": "/(.*)"`: This is a wildcard that means "match any path that a user tries to access."
* `"destination": "/"`: This tells Vercel, "Instead of looking for a file at that path, just serve the main `index.html` file from the root."

#### Step 3: Commit and Push the New Configuration

Now, you need to add this new file to your Git repository and push it so Vercel can see it. Run these commands from your **`CarbonCredit` root folder**.

1.  **Stage the new file:**
    ```bash
    git add vercel.json
    ```

2.  **Commit the change:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: add vercel.json for SPA routing"
    ```

3.  **Push to your `main` branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
