Blue Ledger: A Decentralized Blue Carbon Registry
Blue Ledger is a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) designed to bring unparalleled trust, transparency, and efficiency to the blue carbon credit market. By leveraging blockchain technology, we address the critical need for a verifiable and immutable system for Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of coastal ecosystem restoration projects.

Our platform connects on-the-ground organizations like NGOs and local communities with verifiers and climate finance, creating a seamless pipeline from verified carbon sequestration to tokenized, market-ready carbon credits.

Core Features

Immutable On-Chain Registry: All project data, from initial registration to final verification, is stored immutably on the Polygon blockchain, creating a permanent and tamper-proof audit trail.

Role-Based Access Control: A secure, smart contract-governed system with a designated Admin (NCCR) for verifying projects and authorizing NGOs to register and manage their restoration efforts.

Verifiable Data Storage: All project documentation, including baseline imagery and MRV data, is uploaded to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The immutable IPFS hash is stored on-chain, ensuring that the verified data can never be altered.

End-to-End MRV Workflow: The dApp provides a complete lifecycle management tool for projects, covering registration, MRV submission, and a dedicated verification page for the admin.

Tokenized Carbon Credits (ERC-1155): Upon successful verification, the smart contract mints unique ERC-1155 tokens (BLC - Blue Ledger Carbon) directly to the NGO's wallet, representing a fully traceable and verifiable carbon credit.

Public Transparency Portal: A publicly accessible registry showcases all verified projects and their complete on-chain history, building trust with stakeholders and potential investors.

Future Vision: AI-Powered Verification

The platform is designed to integrate an AI-powered verification assistant. The current UI includes a static demonstration of this future capability, showcasing how AI will be used to analyze satellite or drone imagery to provide data-driven insights on key metrics like sapling counts, canopy health, and environmental anomalies.
